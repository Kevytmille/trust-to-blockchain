## Hashes

X)
One-way function is an umberalla term for anything that is easy to do in one way and nearly impossible to do in reverse.
One-way Hash function is the central piece of modern cryptography that many of the current protocols lean on. It is a way to fingerprint your files by attaching a certain hash to it, if anything in the file changes
the has would also change, thus it becomes a reliable way of saying with an extremely likely accurace that if the hash matched what you expected. Then the file is also the one you want.


# A)
  after some minor trying i was unable to get a 0, but google is your friend and i found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3180374/can-an-md5-hash-begin-with-a-zero

#  B)
  Oh no! it changed!

# C)
  Token lenght exception

# D)
  Exausted

# E)
  Absolute rubbish, it had 3000+ hashrate in the earlier steps but now it dropped to 1943,6 kH/s

# M)
  Hyper-v only supports GPU Pass-through on certain GPU models, i am unable to complete this task :(

# N)
  cd827c33216d4e6e46bc60699f3e18a1 | mille , with hashrate of 2311,6 kH/s
